            Hi! My name is Ryan and I build awesome things on the internet. Back in 2008, I played with custom MySpace themes - which was my introduction into HTML & CSS!
              When I got older I dabbled in a few introductory coding courses during my undergrad years at ASU. Today, I consider myself a life long learner and am pursuing my passion in web development.
              I've had the wonderful opportunity in studying fullstack development through ASU's Coding Bootcamp.
